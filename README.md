#How to get the auto index stuff
I used nginx with fancyindex module for that. Here is the config for it. 
```
location /shsh {
	index index.php;
	fancyindex on;
	fancyindex_exact_size off;
	fancyindex_header "/index/header.html";
	fancyindex_footer "/index/footer.html";
	fancyindex_localtime on;

}
```
